# Lane-detection-OpenCV
This is the repository for the code associated with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBYzkAr4so) video



## Information
The application detects lanes using a ROI, Multiple color thresholds and Edges detection. (i have good comments)
The reason i didn't put in the code for the sign detection is because It's not really optimized yet. Maybe i will post it in the future.

## Versions
OpenCV: 3.4.3

Numpy: 1.15.4

Python 3.7


### Story
This was part of a school project of mine. And the lane/sign detection was my part. Our group got second best of the school and we will compete in the national Raspberry Pi challenge competetion in the Netherlands.
I had 0 experience with this subject and have learned alot from it thanks to all the others that put their code up for my reference. 

So here, i do the exact same. Hope you have some value out of it. If you want to support me, just like the video and give this repo a star. Thank you.
